title: The future of CombineBot 3; A potential switch to discord.js
---

<p>&nbsp;Hey guys. First of all, I know I haven't been posting here in a while, and I apologize but there hasn't been anything huge going on, until now.</p><p><br />So most of you probably know about how my bot is written in Pycord, a discord API wrapper for Python. However, I have recently been learning JavaScript and I have taken a liking to discord.js. It's harder to use, but gives more freedom and low-level API access. I don't know if I want to switch to it, but I have been working on a bot known as CombineJS! It's a discord.js bot (which I may convert to typescript once I learn that) written in JavaScript and I'm planning to add as much of CombineBot as I can to this thing.<br /><br />Hopefully by the time you're reading this, the about section will be updated to include CJS. Thanks for reading!<br /></p>

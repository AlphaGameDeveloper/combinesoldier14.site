title: My New Blog!
---
Well, yet again, I have moved to a new blog! This is *hopefully* the last one I'll be making. This is running on Jekyll on GitHub pages rather than before on Blogger and WordPress. Big thanks to my friend Damien for setting all this up for me. All the CombineBot links will be moved here, including the offical deprecation of the bot's short-lived blogger website. All you need to know is [here](/combinebot).

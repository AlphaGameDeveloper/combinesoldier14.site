# About Me
My name is **CombineSoldier14**. I have an interest in computers, games, and technology. I know these programming languages:
* Python
* Java/TypeScript
* HTML/CSS
* C++

I code various projects and own the Geometry Dash creating team [CMBTeam](https://discord.gg/xz47V9Kvm7). I love video games and I am a fan mainly of Half-Life and Ace Attorney.

I am a massive personality type nerd and am a ISFP 4w5 True Neutral. Pronouns are he/him

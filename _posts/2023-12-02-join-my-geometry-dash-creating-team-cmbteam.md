title: "Join my Geometry Dash creating team, CMBTeam!"

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CMBTeam (short for Combine Team) is a Geometry Dash creating team owned by me, CombineSoldier14! We organize megacollabs and set up creator contests. If you are not part of the team, you can still hang out in the server and have fun, but users are encouraged to apply for decorator or gameplay roles.</p>

<p>What sets us apart from other creating teams is our low standards for decorators and gameplay makers, so even an amateur mediocre decorator (like me) can join in making levels. Ratings aren’t a priority for us and we want everyone to have a chance to improve. Of course, users are always encouraged to do their best work no matter what. Most of our levels will likely be around 9 star to hard demon difficulty.</p>

<p>Also, our megacollabs are tech and glow themed usually. You can submit other styles for applications but just know you’ll have to do that style.</p>

title: The future of UltraBot 2; It's python time!
---

<p>&nbsp;Alright, so my friend Damien as you guys may know at this point as a discord bot of his own, AlphaGameBot. His bot is entirely written in Python. But you guys probably know that I make my bot with BDScript on the Bot Designer for Discord platform. However, I have recently become fed up with their ad based hosting and how locked away they are. So I decided to learn the basics of Python and POOP (Python Object Oriented Programming, great acronym I know) to use pycord and make my own Python bot, UltraBot.py!</p><p>Now as of now UltraBot.py is very experimental and I still don't know a lot about Python. Don't expect this bot to feature advanced commands any time soon.</p><p>Hopefully I can stop using BDScript and start using Python!</p>

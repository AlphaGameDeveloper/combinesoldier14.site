<p>This is a Windows error message that seems to be pretty common. I got it today while turning on my laptop and was freaked out at first. But if you get this message don't freak out; It's usually because you need to plug in your laptop. Do that, and you'll be fine. If you're on a desktop then I don't know what to say. But for my fellow laptop users, this is the best fix. Thanks for reading.</p>

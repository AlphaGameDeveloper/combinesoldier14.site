title: Our Biggest Project Yet, Immortals
---

Hello everyone, the new year is here and I have some big news. It's yet another project, but this time I'm not the only one working on it!

Me and a few of my friends have started work on *Immortals*, a fantasy rogueslike 3D game built in Unity. I am one of the lead programmers and we have been hard at work making the fundamentals of the game.

While I cannot disclose many details of the game at this moment, it will utilize melee sword and shield combat with many unique twists. As said before, this game is very early in development and nowhere near done yet. However, we have been hard at work on enemy AI and player/weapon behavior and movement. Here is my most recent work on the game, using Unity's navmeshes to create an enemy chasing system. Here's a video of it in action!

The game will be available for every major system (Windows, OSX, and Linux). Of course, I know all of you are pandering for a release date, and while I can't give one as we are still figuring out the base fundamentals of the game and Unity as a whole, a rough estimate should be before the end of this year.

Thank you for reading, and expect more updates on this soon!

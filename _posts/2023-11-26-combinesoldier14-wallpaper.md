<p>Do you want your computer to boost your unhealthy ego just by looking at it? Well, unless you're me, that won't happen. But you can still be cool in my book with my CombineSoldier14 wallpaper! I made this myself in Paint.NET. Not super happy with how it turned out (the white on the bottom reflection is kinda ugly) but I still think it looks good.</p>

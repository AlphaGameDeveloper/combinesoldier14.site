Hello again! This is a quick post, but I have recently learned TypeScript, and it's become my new favorite programming language. I of course converted all of CombineJS to TypeScript, [which you can see on GitHub](https://github.com/CombineSoldier14/CombineJS).

Anyway, running CombineJS now *does not* make use of `ts-node` like I planned before. Instead, use `tsc` to compile it to JavaScript whcih you can then run with node. 

Thanks for reading!

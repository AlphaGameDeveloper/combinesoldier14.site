I want to simply give my thoughts out on these games and why I like/dislike them. With that in mind, welcome to my fourth Sonic Review, for Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles from 1994!</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span face="Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: 13.2px;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span face="Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: 13.2px;"><b>Some Background Info</b></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span face="Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: 13.2px;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span face="Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: 13.2px;">After the success of Sonic 2, Sega set out to make the biggest, baddest, most ambitious sonic game yet. And while that was happening, one thing got in the way of it. McDonalds. Yes, so Sega had a deal with McDonalds to sell Sonic 3 toys in early 1994, but there was no way the game could be finished by then, so it had to be split into 2 games: Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic &amp; Knuckles.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span face="Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: 13.2px;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span face="Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: 13.2px;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhkQZORsT6JdJUMMfdP924VigzCQhVjsSaXD9UyET0iIbvrpP9W64PVp0b-CALbuamV5J1koSXsZxqjG7NQP0bamszjR6ecFPWQtUud6pnF74nv1DPvBdMyA-_56upxehU4Ydwh5Dtqlh-atFkH4uu2IOc6DFg9TVVD9MB7asPEFmpi3DXown3gCa7Siho" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhkQZORsT6JdJUMMfdP924VigzCQhVjsSaXD9UyET0iIbvrpP9W64PVp0b-CALbuamV5J1koSXsZxqjG7NQP0bamszjR6ecFPWQtUud6pnF74nv1DPvBdMyA-_56upxehU4Ydwh5Dtqlh-atFkH4uu2IOc6DFg9TVVD9MB7asPEFmpi3DXown3gCa7Siho" width="170" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh8kAvT0FaFwZxldFrCrch5FflxiOF_EKQ2eOl5iAE_ORpPyWFcsjv5CKZO-e4466vDOn_J0h46bakC4mpsbXYkaXIGI42r5p1jAEXX9WfHFSXW3JVqWj7dzNdsPaWSRUZYS1uLHc2QU-s_Ta0aPUui_LJMfJh5RYICLJ4iTeLm2meQytfoUkzb3EX8Y7I" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh8kAvT0FaFwZxldFrCrch5FflxiOF_EKQ2eOl5iAE_ORpPyWFcsjv5CKZO-e4466vDOn_J0h46bakC4mpsbXYkaXIGI42r5p1jAEXX9WfHFSXW3JVqWj7dzNdsPaWSRUZYS1uLHc2QU-s_Ta0aPUui_LJMfJh5RYICLJ4iTeLm2meQytfoUkzb3EX8Y7I" width="173" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">This is for sure an unfortaunate decsion. There are probably a lot of people out there who think "Sonic 3" is the full Sonic 3. In my opinion, I would have called these games Sonic 3: Part 1 and Sonic 3: Part 2. Sure it doesn't sound as nice but it's less confusing. Luckily, the Sonic &amp; Knuckles cartridge contained what they called Lock-On Technology, where you can plug in other cartridges to the S&amp;K one and get access to special content. Plugging in Sonic 2 allows you to play as Knuckles in Sonic 2. You might think plugging in Sonic 1 would allow to play as Knuckles in that game, but no. Due to palette issues, Knuckles in Sonic 1 (at least up until Stealth made his<a href="https://info.sonicretro.org/Knuckles_the_Echidna_in_Sonic_the_Hedgehog"> Knuckles in Sonic 1 rom hack</a>) wasn't possible, so plugging in Sonic 1 gives you access to infinetely randomly generated Blue Sphere stages, which we'll talk about later.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">But the real reason the Lock-On was included was to lock on Sonic 3 which gives you access to the full intended experience, combining both games: Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles. While I could look at these as two seperate games, I see no reason to as this was how the game was originally intended, and I like to play games the way they were intended.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>How do I play Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles?</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">The best version of Sonic 3K by far is <a href="https://sonic3air.org/">Angel Island Revisited</a>, also known as Sonic 3 AIR, which is a full widescreen remaster of Sonic 3 with plenty of customization options and a huge modding community.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">In the game, you can play as Sonic + Tails, Sonic Alone, Tails Alone, Knuckles Alone, and Knuckles + Tails.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">For the sake of this review and the reasons I explained in my <a href="https://combinesoldier14.blogspot.com/2024/03/sonic-hedgehog-2-1992-review.html">Sonic 2 Review</a>, we'll be playing Sonic Alone for this. I'll do a review on Knuckles Story someday, once I play through all of it. Tails can fly and swim, so he's the easy mode, Sonic is normal and Knuckles is slower and has more difficult bosses and routes so he's the hard mode. I won't be talking about Tails because he has the same route as Sonic and is usually easier.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>The Story</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Sonic 3K has the biggest and most interesting story of all the games yet, so get excited!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">After the destruction of the Death Egg from Sonic 2, it has landed on Angel Island, a floating island in the sky that is powered by the Master Emerald, guarded by the echidna Knuckles. Robotnik tricks Knuckles into thinking that Sonic is here to steal the master emerald, when really Robotnik wants it for himself. Meanwhile, Sonic and Tails go to investigate Angel Island...</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>The Game - Special Stages</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Alright, so this game has the best special stages in any of the classic games. They are PERFECT.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg5PbMtdm3necO0aw7cJoGXhp38ATdwGAqja2rtnrqwfRvRjELsW-jKvVVCc_MvHqZCGOBVKafChj6t3ktLmIWreQWW-qVrcLwMngYQ1ry0jxRgDO7Xo3yeKU7HpRU-tPqEW-OgYO0PyfHvIy0Ig4mqt1EnBg4wXQ48qTbcXfvmgy1liIwU_Rcq41j07Dw" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg5PbMtdm3necO0aw7cJoGXhp38ATdwGAqja2rtnrqwfRvRjELsW-jKvVVCc_MvHqZCGOBVKafChj6t3ktLmIWreQWW-qVrcLwMngYQ1ry0jxRgDO7Xo3yeKU7HpRU-tPqEW-OgYO0PyfHvIy0Ig4mqt1EnBg4wXQ48qTbcXfvmgy1liIwU_Rcq41j07Dw" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">You run around collecting blue spheres, and if you touch a red sphere you die. But touching a blue sphere instantly turns into a red sphere, so you have to be careful. If you circle around a group of blue spheres they turn into rings which you can collect. Getting all rings in a stage guarantees a perfect bonus and gives you shit loads of points. There are also yellow spheres which bounce you, and the stage gets faster as you go on. These are so fun and so good. They aren't unfair and luck based like Sonic 1's were, they aren't overly difficult or have bad visibilty like Sonic 2's, they are just perfect. The only real issue I have with these stages is that the controls are a little delayed, but I've played these so many times to the point where I have very much gotten used to them.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">You enter the stages through finding giant rings that you enter around the levels, which also makes these pretty easy? This is the only classic sonic game I've gotten super sonic in, but there's a good reason for that which you'll see later.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>The Game - Angel Island Zone</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhuW8g6_qyFqnJ2sb3gPQ6DwDkgBe4KBPd5GVkKf9pJFocZBKUi1_GJ1IeSe8eY6RepuskEH7Xy-2RYtqPINapoJtzzb9I2xqF8ZViiYZD8pYoSEiv4v3YWezfQW4syeWRJyCM0lpkjE44UYdXJXx24qp1-5rjbYsSY3JNJ8wozGg5CP-TSmDJpYV58Qpk" style="font-size: 13.2px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="224" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhuW8g6_qyFqnJ2sb3gPQ6DwDkgBe4KBPd5GVkKf9pJFocZBKUi1_GJ1IeSe8eY6RepuskEH7Xy-2RYtqPINapoJtzzb9I2xqF8ZViiYZD8pYoSEiv4v3YWezfQW4syeWRJyCM0lpkjE44UYdXJXx24qp1-5rjbYsSY3JNJ8wozGg5CP-TSmDJpYV58Qpk" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">We start off the game with a cutscene that shows Sonic and Tails flying into Angel Island on the Tornado and then Sonic jumping off and becoming Super Sonic. After flying into the zone, Knuckles pops out of the ground and PUNCHES sonic out of his super form knocking the chaos emeralds out of him, this shows that Knuckles is tough and not to be messed with. Knuckles collects the emeralds and runs off.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Now before I get into this game you guys need to know something, if I seem biased or constantly loving this game, it's because I am. Sonic 3K is my favorite Sonic game of all time, and is one of my most favorite games period. I'd argue it beats out a few of the Half-Life games (which HL1 is my most favorite game period besides Portal 2) in terms of quality.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Now that that's over, I also want to talk about how this game presents itself, as it's very different from the style Sonic 1 and 2 go for. Now don't get me wrong, I think this game is beautiful. I still think Sonic CD looks better but damn, this game is wonderful and so pleasing to look at. But I honestly prefer the art style Sonic 1 and 2 go for. Sonic 3 was the first sonic game to use 3D models rendered in as some game sprites, like the title screen, and I really don't like this style. It hasn't aged super well compared to the hand-made cartoony look the other games have. Sonic 3 is more realistic and detailed, which I just don't think works for a game like this. I particularly do not like Sonic's sprite in this game. They made his pupils smaller which gives him more attitude, but I really miss the old expressive cute sonic from the older games. (Yes, I really like cute sonic.) and I don't like how fat and detailed everything looks. Also, Sonic 3 puts this weird blue tint on its sprites. It's not that I don't like old mature sonic, I think Sonic Boom has my favorite Sonic and Amy designs as well as my favorite versions of those characters in general.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">I can look past most of this but it is an issue with the game for me. Anyway, Sonic has a new move here and its one of my favorites: the Insta Shield. If you jump while in the air, Sonic will for a split second put a shield on him which extends his hitbox, meaning you can nuke bosses and protect yourself from some attacks and I LOVE it. Since I'm a bit of an Insta Shield master I use it very often in this game. (I mean, not to brag but I'm kind of a classic sonic master as a whole...)</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Anyway, Angel Island Zone is a GREAT first sonic level. In fact, it might be the best sonic starting level ever. There's lots of speed, platforming, and exploration all into one, which all levels in this game do perfectly. Halfway through the first act, Angel Island Zone becomes Angel Island Zone but in California! As in the whole zone catches on fire. (Hey, I live in California so I should be allowed to make this joke).</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Act 1 of these levels now ends with its own mini boss which usually are pretty easy. I mean even the normal bosses in this game, in classic sonic fashion are usually pretty easy with a few exceptions. The miniboss in Act 1 is this ball thing that shoots fire, and the final boss starts with a pathetic bomb sequence and then switches to Robotnik shooting fireballs at you.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>The Game - Hydrocity Zone</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgXouU2ZPpp-C6oXm-CwOaG_0EzIN8nQcXveSPiIaaXOw9g6cBFET2hdWuyZIuS7FetDNjYIqVVsM12bFiAyOsYQCdWiYXiIkSMlynTULVdjFfMkwpybsdbpjNbsb3KmhB6ZkThvoKSmz2sJvG4rNb3l268bVFZo_2oCKyQ7bDYaLxiWpVNlBykudH7XJY" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="224" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgXouU2ZPpp-C6oXm-CwOaG_0EzIN8nQcXveSPiIaaXOw9g6cBFET2hdWuyZIuS7FetDNjYIqVVsM12bFiAyOsYQCdWiYXiIkSMlynTULVdjFfMkwpybsdbpjNbsb3KmhB6ZkThvoKSmz2sJvG4rNb3l268bVFZo_2oCKyQ7bDYaLxiWpVNlBykudH7XJY" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">The second level in the game is Hydrocity, and is the best Sonic water level of all time. Not only is the music incredible (which goes for the whole game, Sonic 3 has one of the best Sonic soundtracks which is saying something since all Sonic music is usually amazing) but the speed in this stage is so damn fast! It's my second favorite level in the game, behind a level that's coming up. The miniboss is this ball thing you have to destroy, and the final boss is Robotnik shooting bombs at you, which you have to use their explosions to propel yourself up to hit. The bosses in this game are just amazing!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>The Game - Marble Garden Zone</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhIfFJ16_AOkdIU3RGS9Du1UKlMuWFLy06c5YSVDdvVzVsTxC_I11BkaW4XmSdktvvxbmw_FfpAfCzs31mTaIjTIaChZxz-RquqfAAsAtMEG2_JKm_3K07zIu0IM_aGLMayPslZWWfg54jRXK_prf5TRpe2hqcU-GRO0hBx2M0pGV-gBXxtNSc04kzh6Os" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="224" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhIfFJ16_AOkdIU3RGS9Du1UKlMuWFLy06c5YSVDdvVzVsTxC_I11BkaW4XmSdktvvxbmw_FfpAfCzs31mTaIjTIaChZxz-RquqfAAsAtMEG2_JKm_3K07zIu0IM_aGLMayPslZWWfg54jRXK_prf5TRpe2hqcU-GRO0hBx2M0pGV-gBXxtNSc04kzh6Os" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">The third level in the game is Marble Garden, one of the more weaker zones. I don't think it's bad by any means but I just think it's kind of boring. Nothing that notable. The miniboss is this thing like the boss from Mystic Cave in the last game that goes into the celing and rains down hell on you. The final boss is very cool though. Tails grabs you and flies in the air while you try to hit Robotnik flying around.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>The Game - Carnival Night Zone</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgFIyTFt82NgNMX2UROYEzdLtImh9gTOh0kNNeo7kfHhoR-2BgSBhw7Y0foXlu64VHkdkCXjjcFy253L8yGvosw4MrQdDM_Lhvy0GvCpjkTaUS9gttYvk1Cj0NSBQLOy795im04HdexhNXOhKc_A0oieMDsTMJztCoNaRxjnPl9VkdLF4FTepAwYkeC_sc" style="font-size: 13.2px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="224" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgFIyTFt82NgNMX2UROYEzdLtImh9gTOh0kNNeo7kfHhoR-2BgSBhw7Y0foXlu64VHkdkCXjjcFy253L8yGvosw4MrQdDM_Lhvy0GvCpjkTaUS9gttYvk1Cj0NSBQLOy795im04HdexhNXOhKc_A0oieMDsTMJztCoNaRxjnPl9VkdLF4FTepAwYkeC_sc" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">The fourth zone in the game is not really an improvement. Probably my least favorite level in the game (though it's still good, which is saying something) is Carnival Night Zone. It's a pinball-ish level with boring music and annoying gimmicks. It also goes on for far too long, and, of course, you can't talk about Carnival Night in Sonic 3 without mentioning the barrel of doom. There are barrels across the levels that you stand on and press up and down on the d-pad to control. Sounds simple right? Well, the game never tells you how to do that and many people (myself included) got stuck here on their first playthrough trying to figure out how this thing works. The boss is cool though. The miniboss is this electric thing that shoots out a spiky platform that destroys the ground, and the boss (which is even easier) is Robotnik releasing an electric ball that draws you towards it.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>The Game - Flying Battery Zone</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjQqSQtYh8L05ZoChP1-DaLr3YUMb7hXT6V6fXRy-ZrnyJdM51qlhh2teN6On_1z-Fcwa4K-XsJbr6CMSjcTgeE42Mrq880z7eUt5wdVaPaew_od7tNMJr5g3ObECQiL_L0kT5L-BSKqAhTfqcSLgHmK17QHKsPfCK8RwVGpO1n9Ze5ulyHt7BFPMZomh0" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="224" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjQqSQtYh8L05ZoChP1-DaLr3YUMb7hXT6V6fXRy-ZrnyJdM51qlhh2teN6On_1z-Fcwa4K-XsJbr6CMSjcTgeE42Mrq880z7eUt5wdVaPaew_od7tNMJr5g3ObECQiL_L0kT5L-BSKqAhTfqcSLgHmK17QHKsPfCK8RwVGpO1n9Ze5ulyHt7BFPMZomh0" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">For those of you that have played this game you might be a bit confused. Flying Battery in the game takes place way later on, why are we discussing it now? Well, it's simple. When this game was being made, this was where Flying Battery was supposed to take place in the zone order originally and it being here makes more sense to me that way.

It's one of my favorite levels in this game because I love the aesthetic and music of it, it feels like what Wing Fortress Zone from Sonic 2 should have been. The bosses are... interesting. The miniboss is a repeat of Sonic 2's metropolis act 2 boss with this stupid animal cage thing that you get it to hit itself, and the final boss starts with Robotnik using an invincible laser (until he blows up himself) and you run out of that room to face him in this pill spike boss that shoots fire.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>The Game - Ice Cap Zone</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgHTYFtVz_EMBbe7XPWDhin_5bLcjfPrkAaoALxqNSSWE29LexfUBITKQzM9fg_B7Xi8ziK9uHwMJVaD6ad-K4bM4HItN7ISiELOH7MdF_JpotBMUz7OXTC0IgiHlUBpnIH18dcDg2oSG9kQ0--tEXMaYGHP3pg1pgKkjUjoDlz62j2lIgqEDZWT5vDHgg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="224" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgHTYFtVz_EMBbe7XPWDhin_5bLcjfPrkAaoALxqNSSWE29LexfUBITKQzM9fg_B7Xi8ziK9uHwMJVaD6ad-K4bM4HItN7ISiELOH7MdF_JpotBMUz7OXTC0IgiHlUBpnIH18dcDg2oSG9kQ0--tEXMaYGHP3pg1pgKkjUjoDlz62j2lIgqEDZWT5vDHgg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Here we are. My favorite level in the game, and one of the best experiences I've ever had with any game ever: Ice Cap Zone. This level starts with a wonderful snowboarding segment before going into this atmospheric deep cave level that uses some really cool gimmicks and some of the strongest exploration this series has to offer. Act 2 has you going outside with this beautiful background. The miniboss is this ball that fires snowballs and the final boss is actually difficult and interesting, with Robotnik shooting air that freezes you.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">But I've been saving the best part of this level for last: the music. Ice Cap's music is lonely, nostaglic, and one of the best and most immersive game tunes I have ever heard. This zone is the best part of the game for me and is one of my favorite levels in gaming period.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>The Game - Launch Base Zone</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiEvhbZo71zl-__F6FAyazcCYI-fl5bffdEnxTlPIYeqFUcgtL2hRUbYfRZKqF59XJSbFH4eZ_9MxDJ8UJ4YopD6n2TGd3JD288WZJzOfjHDKa9pxrcHpBgFbE7V3YPC_5xG0xl7BeQVlt6IXfiY1hPY1s8AjGL2sq1Hn1CUhrVXLxDjDy3Z8dBJ4cFgtQ" style="font-size: 13.2px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="224" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiEvhbZo71zl-__F6FAyazcCYI-fl5bffdEnxTlPIYeqFUcgtL2hRUbYfRZKqF59XJSbFH4eZ_9MxDJ8UJ4YopD6n2TGd3JD288WZJzOfjHDKa9pxrcHpBgFbE7V3YPC_5xG0xl7BeQVlt6IXfiY1hPY1s8AjGL2sq1Hn1CUhrVXLxDjDy3Z8dBJ4cFgtQ" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Launch Base Zone is the seventh zone in the game and is the last zone in the Sonic 3 half of the game, and I really love it. There's not a ton I have to say, it's another beautiful and fun zone overall. I do feel the exploration took a bit of a hit with this zone, I haven't ever found a single big ring here, but it's not that big of a deal. The miniboss is this thing that shoots balls you have to avoid and the final boss is this egg tower thing you slowly destroy. But since this is the final zone on the Sonic 3 half of the game, there's a special final boss on that game only, a big arm boss with Robotnik trying to grab you. It's a really good boss and while I tend to skip it these days for the sake of brevity, Sonic 3 AIR gives you an option to re-enable it.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>The Game - Mushroom Hill Zone</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjs-R_8r2n9teDNqT5HP-AgK4Pyp8tkmSb5YHxtLlhPrJ6u526AA9tIfzhD9WTz72m5zv5LN0CJVJSbgbge0uykBwP95kQkzh6lZXeOw1EUSWAEE7odwxcFsJgy9_SkkXfHGuymB-6Na54UVcBkFFdiOX-R52QvquOLKKqLpndvBKyIiGKZO_DrFnunllc" style="font-size: 13.2px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="224" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjs-R_8r2n9teDNqT5HP-AgK4Pyp8tkmSb5YHxtLlhPrJ6u526AA9tIfzhD9WTz72m5zv5LN0CJVJSbgbge0uykBwP95kQkzh6lZXeOw1EUSWAEE7odwxcFsJgy9_SkkXfHGuymB-6Na54UVcBkFFdiOX-R52QvquOLKKqLpndvBKyIiGKZO_DrFnunllc" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">After the Death Egg plummets down, the Sonic &amp; Knuckles half of the game starts. Personally I enjoy the first half more but this one is really great too. Mushroom Hill Zone is a good new starting level and is especially strong in exploration. Not quite as good as Angel Island, but it's a great zone too. The miniboss is this lumberjack robot and the final boss is very cool. You have to run and hit Robotnik while jumping over spike bars in a 3D-like space. At the beginning of the zone you'll notice Knuckles closing a door and if you re-open it you'll gain access to a rainbow ring, where it will take you to the upcoming Hidden Palace Zone (no, not the one from Sonic 2) and take all of your current chaos emeralds and shoot them into the new Super Emeralds, where now you have to go through Giant Rings again to do more difficult blue sphere stages to unlock Sonic's final form, Hyper Sonic. A super flashing rainbow sonic that cannot drown and has a double jump dash that is a screen nuke and kills all enemies on screen. Now as much as I love hyper sonic, I am not a fan of how after the emeralds are taken from you at first, you cannot become super sonic until you have gotten the super emeralds which can take a while. If you could still be super while recollecting the emeralds, I would love this but having that taken away just isn't fun</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>The Game - Sandopolis Zone</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEifICfYPQZN1uexKbO5aI35TugWI0obYOHeDwCjNbviZdtYrAQOuXUHuWX99V6tpuXwIIcCbIxilnOtORzER09vBYOdG-VWZ4Zxuxt0X9T-e0T_2YIk-NK74Hkwi89h4bP4ffA5SUVQW96dGXvwGeHRnf9j0EEglZOcLngBOwxV1coXP_Iyki-xMVaX3I4" style="font-size: 13.2px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="224" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEifICfYPQZN1uexKbO5aI35TugWI0obYOHeDwCjNbviZdtYrAQOuXUHuWX99V6tpuXwIIcCbIxilnOtORzER09vBYOdG-VWZ4Zxuxt0X9T-e0T_2YIk-NK74Hkwi89h4bP4ffA5SUVQW96dGXvwGeHRnf9j0EEglZOcLngBOwxV1coXP_Iyki-xMVaX3I4" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Usually this is where Flying Battery would take place but since we did the original order we now are playing Sandopolis Zone, the ninth level in the game. It's my second least favorite level in this game but is still really good. Act 1 is a little too linear but has a great song and beautiful enviornment. Act 2... is where the problems start. Not only is the zone darker and loses character, but it's filled with annoying gameplay gimmicks the infinetely falling sand hill which I still have trouble figuring out to this day and the sand rising parts and the timed door parts, and the ghosts. The miniboss is really fucking weird and easy. It's this old rock statue that you can easily kill and the final boss is actually pretty cool. It's an egyptian statue that you jump on its hands to knock back his head and attack Robotnik.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>The Game - Lava Reef Zone</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh2LWS7Afh1QSgax8RrDmZQMCOiJSYKBeadJqKVenglDZ0_wyzEtAz30kuBvySFup5i2mVuPUaeYa4coKntL3OFHNyBHYSi_uB0jRwCOIda5DdrCgWnNNWILzX_0hU2XYenblQLlHzrRA-QR-x1rwkGJXxU-CgQFJZJzegOYIZzn3bBD79frBdzdKJqjG8" style="font-size: 13.2px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="224" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh2LWS7Afh1QSgax8RrDmZQMCOiJSYKBeadJqKVenglDZ0_wyzEtAz30kuBvySFup5i2mVuPUaeYa4coKntL3OFHNyBHYSi_uB0jRwCOIda5DdrCgWnNNWILzX_0hU2XYenblQLlHzrRA-QR-x1rwkGJXxU-CgQFJZJzegOYIZzn3bBD79frBdzdKJqjG8" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Lava Reef is the tenth level in the game and is so, SO good. It has a great song and aesthetic, and since we're nearing the end of the game it gets you pumped. The exploration is perfect and Act 2 goes for a totally different crystal calmer aesthetic. The miniboss has these tentacle things that shoot you as well as a hand that tries to crush you, but also has the best final boss of the whole game besides Death Egg. It starts with this robot chasing you, and then these platforms fall into lava, and then at the bottom Robotnik appears switching from both sides and the platforms start feeding into him now as he shoots bombs on them. Pretty much all of the difficulty here can be removed if you have a fire shield but it's still really fun.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>The Game - Hidden Palace Zone</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhA3wo-mRotFvzXSv_1jxV_6rkmyhsHZujFWHMbdne9EIZkkHZ8bGzrRUA1-3YVsyyWVxq2G66WnnkJPBuRW4lHr3NqacdHKf9IyTDERWKm3avDB-G_PETXr-3SXEDoMmjrHCA23h8UBimoWaJo17LQV06dKk89oQTtLLAet9NUD6hEa1jSh_560uJ8f_o" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhA3wo-mRotFvzXSv_1jxV_6rkmyhsHZujFWHMbdne9EIZkkHZ8bGzrRUA1-3YVsyyWVxq2G66WnnkJPBuRW4lHr3NqacdHKf9IyTDERWKm3avDB-G_PETXr-3SXEDoMmjrHCA23h8UBimoWaJo17LQV06dKk89oQTtLLAet9NUD6hEa1jSh_560uJ8f_o" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">As mentioned before, Hidden Palace is the eleventh zone and actually does have level design for it. Remember that asshole Knuckles who has been harassing you the entire game? Well now you get a fight with him which, while still being easy is better than anything the adventure games could dream up. Afterwards, we go to the Super Emerald room and we see something no mario game or platformer to this day usually does: actual character story. Robotnik swoops in and takes the Master Emerald, betraying Knuckles right in front of him. With Knuckles having no other option, he teams up with you and takes you to Sky Sanctuary.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>The Game - Sky Sanctuary Zone</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgqACjebV1ynv4vu-h4JR-pa8BnUFtjwhxPUgKcHXCqZx58zbWqoytrd_WIVAyuZtE8VI1cidEHfhK8fFdI30meeQmBv57imnG4U1fnwuJllFGa4LaaAMm3-hh4FldCT7Z1aog597vOXiu8KQUluUthf2pJp0SwLuOgq4TFY0FRnBc7GoqJWZsPgsh8zEI" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="224" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgqACjebV1ynv4vu-h4JR-pa8BnUFtjwhxPUgKcHXCqZx58zbWqoytrd_WIVAyuZtE8VI1cidEHfhK8fFdI30meeQmBv57imnG4U1fnwuJllFGa4LaaAMm3-hh4FldCT7Z1aog597vOXiu8KQUluUthf2pJp0SwLuOgq4TFY0FRnBc7GoqJWZsPgsh8zEI" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">The twelfth zone in the game is Sky Sanctuary and even though it's only one act, it's really good! The platforming is great, and Robotnik's new sonic robot is your enemy: Mecha Sonic. Mecha Sonic is an amazing robot sonic that you fight in many moments using old bosses from Sonic 1 and 2 the green hill ball and chain boss, and the weird bubble thing from Sonic 2 Metropolis Zone, as well as Silver Sonic's fighting pattern. But with him out of the way you progress to the last and best final sonic zone...</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>The Game - Death Egg Zone</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgC_79pMVIO2CUWbqpvxf-O_UqA81YP1pyhLpy06ntbuPbXuEa8NzLLilG8Z9bT8uU9sb4I8QJiTHIEYi5n75ZPsC8cih02Z53nGErn9n2cvkpaAWXkMQhyz0KKtESx_XuDrgjhp0K08ToS9BuJPMRb1TpsljA1WwV6sDbCsFKWgUwP407Ly8w2fJq8FeM" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="224" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgC_79pMVIO2CUWbqpvxf-O_UqA81YP1pyhLpy06ntbuPbXuEa8NzLLilG8Z9bT8uU9sb4I8QJiTHIEYi5n75ZPsC8cih02Z53nGErn9n2cvkpaAWXkMQhyz0KKtESx_XuDrgjhp0K08ToS9BuJPMRb1TpsljA1WwV6sDbCsFKWgUwP407Ly8w2fJq8FeM" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">The thirteenth zone of the game is Death Egg zone, and this zone is very good, but it's got its problems. The first pro is just how many cool gameplay gimmicks are here, as well as the background (I think?) being a reference possibly to the Empire Strikes Back scene, where Luke and Vader are in that big mechanical side of the area and Luke gets his hand cut off. I don't know if that's what they were referencing but as a huge star wars fan I appreciate it. But this zone has a lot of bad too. There are some absolutely obnoxious gimmicks here like the light circles that take forever and the treadmill spike corridors. The miniboss is just ridicolous and I usually save my rings to become Super Sonic in that part. The final bosses are great though. It first starts with this machine that shoots bombs at you with the gravity changing, the next boss being 2 hands that try to crush you, and the final boss being a robot that chases you while you have to destroy the front of it and hit it, while it fires a big laser and some fire, all of which are fun.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b>The Game - Doomsday Zone</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhbgO6-fWv2_WJRE5WKl-mTOq0Bm4WqKv3PEZjcRRYZiZeXOwncsfZ_cI244gij3owDeshTTctZnyN6a2i77h98Xh6gT2idJ3rfwHTxAmWQFdrJAoD8ouBygz5JAIBVn3FrJR97RpDKQshnyQ5s8vJyvQ7Baf-GZ2iKXoDoBEYIIgS4jl7n3bz-zNlm22s" style="font-size: 13.2px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="224" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhbgO6-fWv2_WJRE5WKl-mTOq0Bm4WqKv3PEZjcRRYZiZeXOwncsfZ_cI244gij3owDeshTTctZnyN6a2i77h98Xh6gT2idJ3rfwHTxAmWQFdrJAoD8ouBygz5JAIBVn3FrJR97RpDKQshnyQ5s8vJyvQ7Baf-GZ2iKXoDoBEYIIgS4jl7n3bz-zNlm22s" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">The fourteenth and last zone in the game is only accessible if you got all the chaos emeralds and consists of Super Sonic chasing down Eggman while flying through space and getting eggman's missles to hit him all while maintaining your ring count.

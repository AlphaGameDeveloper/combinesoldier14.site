title: "Dedication by NikroPlays 100%, new hardest!"
---
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well here we are. A new hardest, and very quickly too. Bloodbath Easy, my previous hardest, was only on top of my list for about 2 or 3 weeks. Damn. Well I suppose this level is much more deserving of a top 1 anyway. The gameplay is VERY good, I enjoyed it a lot, and I definetely recommend if you just beat deadlocked or harder.</p>

<p>I beat this on my own copy to fix bugs and to add start positions, but after I beat it I went back and noclipped the one on the servers.</p>

<p>Dedication was a level made in early 2.0 (2016 I think?) by Nikrodox (aka NikroPlays) as the first level in the dedication series, which Nikro would then controversially follow up this level with Allegiance, an extreme demon. Allegiance was then years later followed up with Renevant (which is a horrible level that is still high on the list today) and the finale to the series, Anathema, is coming soon.</p>

<p>But of course, you can't talk about Dedication without mentioning the elephant in the room: its rating. RobTop was high when rating this apperently and rated this a 6 STAR. HARDER. What in the fuck?! Literally everyone I've ever seen in my life who plays GD (along with me) all agree this is a medium or maybe easy demon. Hopefully it will be rerated someday.</p>

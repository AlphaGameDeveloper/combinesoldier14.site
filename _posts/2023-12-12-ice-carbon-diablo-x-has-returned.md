title: "Ice Carbon Diablo X has returned!"

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is something I have been waiting for for a very, very long time. Ice Carbon Diablo X (ICDX for brevity) is one of of, if not the most famous GD level of all time. It's an old demon released by Roadbose back in 1.6 (2014) and was a Clubstep remake considered impossible for the time, until Riot beat it in 1.9. It's been praised for having good gameplay and being very influencial overall. However, I believe somewhere around 2019, something happened to ICDX on the servers that would change its legacy.</p>

<p>It was downrated from an extreme demon to an insane demon.</p>

<p>Normally I wouldn't care so much about this but this is a straight up innacurate difficulty. In my opinion, this level is far more an extreme demon, with some saying it's even harder than Acu. </p>

<p>It remained this way for many years until eventually, about a week ago, it was raised back up to an extreme, as it should be. It's been placed at #867 on the AREDL list, being the 2nd easiest extreme in the game. This is far too low, it should at least be raised above Acu, which will hopefully happen soon.</p>

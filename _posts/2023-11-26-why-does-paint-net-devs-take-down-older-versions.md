<p>Ok so this is the first time I've posted a rant like this. You'll probably see many more of these in the future.</p>

<p>So I have a laptop that I recently installed Windows 7 Pro on, the best OS ever made (fight me, Frenchie!) and I used it to create a wallpaper that I will post about soon once I finish it, and I used Paint.NET to make it. Now look, I LOVE paint.net. Even if it's hard to use and the majority of its talents come from plugins it's still great. But my god... Why do the dick-sucking Paint.net devs take down older versions of the app?? I get wanting people to stay on the latest version but there are many good reasons to at least host older versions somewhere? What if their computer can't handle new paint.net? Why are you not archiving them so they don't become lost? Or, in my case, what if the OS you're using doesn't support the newest paint.net??? Stop fucking taking down older versions and let your consumers do what they want!!! There are a lot of people still using Windows older than 10 (like me) who can't get your app because your dumbass stopped people from getting important software.</p>

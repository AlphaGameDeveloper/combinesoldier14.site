<p>So as many of you know, Geometry Dash 2.2 is released (which will get its own post, eventually) and Mega Hack, the mod panel and macro recorder I use for showcasing alongside basically every other bot is broken due to 2.2 and until the devs fix them I have no way to record levels. Just wanted to let you all know that.</p>
